I used more lemon juice than called for. I had a hard time just mixing this up in a bowl, so I threw it in the food processor and pulsed it until it was the consistency that I wanted, which worked great. Spicy, garlicky and lemony...a perfect balance...I will be making this again!

It is super easy and my Baba Ghanoush was delicious. I even added a few red pepper flakes and a spice called Zatar and then some olive oil and it was just like at a restaurant! Never thought it was this easy. You can adjust the amount of garlic tahini or lemon juice to how you like it. I baked my eggplant in the oven.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":"1","bestRating":"5","ratingValue":5},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Linda Brokopp","image":null,"sameAs":"https:\/\/www.allrecipes.com\/cook\/13981041\/"}},{"@type":"Review","datePublished":"2016-07-03T22:12:12.9Z","reviewBody":"I loved this recipe! The only things I did differently were to lightly saut\u00e9 the crushed garlic in olive oil and add cumin powder. It was very good.
